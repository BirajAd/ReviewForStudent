We visit so many businesses for different purpose and sometime we need help to choose the right one for us, review can come in to play in
the situation. However, we can't trust all the reviews posted for the businesses, they sometimes are biased towards or against the business.
Wouldn't it have been really great if we could minimize that? That is what R4S does.

ReviewForStudent(R4S) is a website where a user can search for nearby businesses around a college/University in the US and post review for them.
It is a yelp like website, which is for the use of students only. A user can sign up for the website only if he is a student. Any user can
visit the website and check the reviews posted for any businesses. However, when it comes to posting reviews it is limited to only users and 
all our users are students.
